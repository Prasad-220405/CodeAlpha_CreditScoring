Credit Scoring Model 
 Project Overview:
This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.
The objective of this project is to build a Credit Scoring Model that predicts an individual's creditworthiness based on financial and personal data.
 Objective:
To predict whether a customer is:
 Creditworthy (Good)
 Not Creditworthy (Bad)
using machine learning classification techniques.
 Dataset Used:
The dataset contains financial attributes such as:
Income
Loan Amount
Credit History
Age
Employment Status
Other financial indicators
File used:
credit_data.csv
Technologies & Libraries Used:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
